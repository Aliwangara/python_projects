# Assignment — Student Report System

# You’ll build a CLI program that manages students and their scores.

# Features to include:

# Add a student

# Ask for student’s name.

# Ask for 3 scores (integers).

# Store them in a dictionary like:

# {"Ali": [85, 90, 78]}


# View all students

# Print each student with their scores and their average.

# Search for a student

# Ask for a name.

# If found, show their scores + average.

# Top student

# Use max(..., key=lambda ...) to find the student with the highest average score.

# Sort students

# Option to sort students by:

# Name (A–Z)

# Average score (highest → lowest)

# Exit
