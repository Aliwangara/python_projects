# Student Performance Tracker
# ðŸŽ¯ Goal

# Build a program that:

# Stores student details in a CSV file.

# Validates their score.

# Automatically classifies them as Pass or Fail.

# Displays all records neatly at the end.

# ðŸ§¾ Requirements

# File name: performance.csv

# Columns: Name, Age, Score, Status

# Ask the user how many students to add.

# For each student:

# Ask for their name, age, and score.

# If the score:

# >= 50 â†’ status = "Pass"

# < 50 â†’ status = "Fail"

# If score is outside 0â€“100 â†’ skip and show "Invalid score!"

# Save all valid data to the CSV file.

# Finally, read and print all records like this:

# Ali (Age: 21) scored 85 â€” Status: Pass
# George (Age: 20) scored 47 â€” Status: Fail

# ðŸ’¡ Hint

# Youâ€™ll use:

# csv.writer() to write to file

# csv.reader() to read from file

# Conditional logic (if/else) for score validation and pass/fail
